### Learning-to-Hash Survey Paper

The full literature survey that accompanies this website is available [as a research paper](http://seanjmoran.com/pdfs/hashing_review.pdf) currently under submission to a peer-reviewed journal. Full citation information will appear here in due course. In the meantime please feel free to cite the following thesis upon which the review is based:

<pre>

  author       = {Sean Moran}, 
  title        = {Learning to hash for large-scale image retrieval},
  school       = {University of Edinburgh},
  year         = 2016,
}
</pre>

### Presentations and Relevant Introductory Material

Please also see the excellent [tutorial slides](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/slides/L2H.pdf) of [Dr. Wu-Jun Li](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj/) for a nice introduction to the field.

[Dr Victor Lavrenko](https://www.youtube.com/user/victorlavrenko) has two excellent youtube videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Arni-zkqMBA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgH0NP8Qxa8), describing the basics of locality sensitive hashing (LSH). These are ideal for those just entering the field or curious how to apply the method to their problem domain.
